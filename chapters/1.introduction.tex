\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:introduction}
%Motion analysis is the systematic study of human movement, and it is a key component of many fields, including biomecanics, medicine and sports science.
%Kinematics is the study of the motion of objects without considering the forces causing the motion.
-- To populate after objectives.

Can we detect running injuries using kinematic data? -> Lots of research exists that relates injuries to training load, physiological factors that require logitudinal data to be collected during a long period of time

Lots of research into injury risk prediction, but not much into injury detection.
% Research in the domain of ML for injury risk prediction in sports has grown steadily over the last 10 years (https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/59/7/491)


Proof that MAchine learning has been used successfully in the field of biomechanics

\section{Objectives an Scope}\label{sec:intro-objectives-scope}
% -- concise, measurable, and testable
% -- Scope, limits, and assumptions
% -- What does the source study not cover? What is out of scope for us?
%     - Longitudinal analysis
%     - Follow-up on subjects to track evolution of the injury.
%     - Temporal information about the injury (chronic, not chronic, recent, coping, etc...)
Objectives:
O1: The primary objective is to evaluate how well do 4 classical ML models trained on the biomechanical variables provided in the running-injury dataset (N=1402 runners) detect injury status, and determine whether any achieves AUC-ROC > 0.7.

O2: Assess whether advanced deep learning models (Unilateral LSTM, Bilateral LSTM, MC-DCNN) trained on time-series kinematic data significantly (p \le 0.05) outperforms the best baseline by \(\delta\) > 0.05 on the primary metric (AUC-ROC) with 95\% Confidence Interval over 5-fold cross-validation.

O3: Apply post-hoc interpretability techniques (SHAP and saliency maps) to interpret black-box models and identify key kinematic features that contribute most to injury detection.












- to develop a model that can detect running injuries from kinematic data.
- to build on top of the work done by the source paper.
- To use Machine Learning to solve 


Hypothesis:
- Can we detect running injuries using kinematic data (without force data) without longitudinal data?
- We learn from AI system to
