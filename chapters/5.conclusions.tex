\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc-conclusions}
-- Linked to abstract, very focused.
... baseline models remain a robust choice for injury status classification on this dataset.

\section{Limitations}\label{sec:conc-limitations}

\subsection{Data limitations (sample, biases, missingness)}\label{sec:limitations-data}

\subsection{Methodological limitations (assumptions, generalization)}\label{sec:limitations-methods}

\subsection{Evaluation limitations (metrics, external validation)}\label{sec:limitations-evaluation}
-- Approaching the problem as a prediction of the mayority class -> Class imbalnce made things harder
    -- In the future, change to minority class

\section{Future Work}\label{sec:conc-future-work}
-- All of the work that we did not have time to do.
-- What we would do if we had more time.
-- What we would do if we had more data.
-- What we would do if we had more compute.
-- Look into other parts of the gait cycle? Or use the full cycle isntead of only the stance.
